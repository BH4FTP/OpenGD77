# OpenGD77
Firmware for DMR transceivers using the NXP MK22 MCU, AT1846S RF chip and HR-C6000 DMR chipset. Including the Radioddiy GD-77, Baofeng DM-1801 and Baofeng RD-5R.

This repo is a fork of rogerclarkmelborune/OpenGD77 restored to the last public code as of 2021-04-20 (Roger deleted most of the source code after that date.)

# Project status
Roger has indicated that he will no longer be maintaing this project.

## IMPORTANT
The firmware generated by this project is comprised of approximately 30% binary code from the official Raddioity firmware. The CODEC from the original binary is used to avoid intellectual property infringement. Distributing the resulting binary may therefore be problematic from a intellectual property law perspective.
The 30% sealed binary is required to sidestep  potential license issues with the DMR codec
